Configure DNS Records

For a wildcard certificate, you'll need to configure a DNS record. Most DNS providers support the DNS-01 challenge method. Here, I'll provide instructions for setting up a DNS-01 challenge using Cloudflare as an example:

Sign in to your Cloudflare account.
Add a CNAME record for your domain (e.g., *.example.com) pointing to your server's domain (e.g., example.com).


Create Cloudflare API Credentials

Create the file ./private/cloudflare.ini with your Cloudflare API credentials.
Sample:
dns_cloudflare_email = user@host.com
dns_cloudflare_api_key = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
